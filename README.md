WEATHER DASHBOARD ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

A Weather Dashboard is a web application that allows users to search for and view real-time weather information for various cities. It typically fetches weather data using a third-party API (like OpenWeatherMap), and presents current weather, a multi-day forecast, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. Users can also store previous searches for quick access.
